                  I hired Joe for a freelance project. 
                  I was impressed with his ability to quickly learn and implement the latest technology into our project. 
                  I'm very glad we trusted our IT assets with him as we were about to pay a large firm much more.

                  It was a pleasure working with Joe. 
                  He was very professional while maintaining a personal rapport with me. 
                  His networking insight and experience is second to none. 
                  He lead his team by demonstrating mastery of concepts while taking time to mentor others. 
                  Donâ€™t miss the opportunity to work with Joe!
